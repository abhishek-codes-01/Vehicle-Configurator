# Vehicle_Configurator
Project Description:

Vehicle Configurator (V-CONF) is a full-stack web-based B2B portal designed for rental car companies to configure and purchase vehicles online. The application is built using Spring Boot 3 with a microservices architecture on the backend and React with Next.js on the frontend. Users can log in, select a vehicle segment (e.g., SUV, Sedan), choose a manufacturer and model, and specify the quantity with built-in validation rules. They can then view default configurations or customize the vehicle's interior, exterior, and accessories.

The system calculates pricing based on selections, generates professional PDF invoices, and sends them via email to customers. It uses MySQL 8 with Spring Data JPA for data management, JWT-based authentication (without refresh tokens), and Lombok to reduce boilerplate code. Spring Profiles manage environment-specific configs, and Docker is used to containerize the application. Microservices communicate using RestTemplate, and aspects like logging are handled using Spring AOP with @Before and @After. Testing is supported with the Mockito framework. The frontend offers a fast, responsive UI and interacts securely with backend REST APIs.
